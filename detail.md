## Experience

Started watching the project in its first month.  Join once it was ok to place hotspots in my city.  Manage a fleet of IOT hotspots for an investor group (all friends).  Doing my best to place Helium Mobile Hotspots as well.
Honored to have been an elected member of the MOBILE Working Group since its inception.

## Voting Philosophy

My voting policy is clear; I am fighting for the hotspot owner/operator. A long-term vision is the only way to view this project.  It can represent the best of decentralization; anyone can participate, anyone can succeed, and the more we work together the greater the success for all involved.  We must make choices that lift up Nova, the Foundation, and ourselves; we are one and all of us can win.  Good decisions from good votes will yield good outcomes.
